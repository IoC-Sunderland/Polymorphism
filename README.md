# Polymorphism
Python is implicity polymorphic i.e. functions can take arguments of different types (e.g. list, string, dicts) and still work accordingly.

They can also behave differently depending on the type of the arguments we provide.

# Examples of Polymorphism in Python
## Method Overloading:
Method Overloading is when we can have multiple methods with the same name but a different method signature.

E.g. in Java

```
int myMethod(int x)
float myMethod(float x)
double myMethod(double x, double y)
```

Python doesn't support Method Overloading. If you define two methods with same name the last one defined will be called.

See example: <strong>Method Overloading</strong>

## Operator Overloading:
This is when an operator can be used with different data types seamlessly.

See example: <strong>Operator Overloading</strong>

## Method Overriding:
Method Overriding enables a subclass/child class to provide it's own implementation of a method that is defined in its superclasse/parent class.

See example: <strong>Method Overriding</strong>
